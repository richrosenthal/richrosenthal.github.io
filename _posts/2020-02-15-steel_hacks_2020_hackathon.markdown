One of the things that Flatiron has given me confidence to do is participate in Hackathons.
I tried participating in them prior but I was so nervous that I ended up not forming a team or contributing much. 
However, I feel much more confident in participating. 

So I'm currently writing this while I'm finishing up a project for submission. My two other teammates are both computer science majors. We were able to both benefit from our different backgrounds. They were able to contribute the theory for our project and I took it upon myself to do all of the front-end development. 

It's awesome because I had just finished the bonus CSS and HTML sections on Learn.co so I felt pretty good going into this even though I have not had much real world experience. 

That's the best part of Hackathons, you have no choice but to quickly learn a new technology and read through documentation. No slacking allowed. Our project was creating a website for students and researchers to check how credible an academic paper is by how often that author is cited or the amount of publications the author has published. 

One of the things I learned today was the benefit of using BootStrap. I was able to quickly put together a website with very little pain. 

I can't wait to see the results. We only have an hour left to submit our posts.
